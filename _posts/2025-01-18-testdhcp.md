title: Setting up a DHCP server
---


## Finding the interface
```bash
ifconfig
```


## Configuring an interface

Check the default interface on which the DHCP server is configured.

File is found in /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server

Make sure to add the name of the interface in the INTERFACESv4=""



## Configuring the dhcpd.conf

There's a file in vim /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

```bash
25 # option definitions common to all supported networks...
24 option domain-name "example.org";
23 option domain-name-servers ns1.example.org, ns2.example.org;
21 default-lease-time 600;
20 max-lease-time 7200;


18 # The ddns-updates-style parameter controls whether or not the server will
17 # attempt to do a DNS update when a lease is confirmed. We default to the
16 # behavior of the version 2 packages ('none', since DHCP v2 didn't
15 # have support for DDNS.)
14 ddns-update-style none;


12 # If this DHCP server is the official DHCP server for the local
11 # network, the authoritative directive should be uncommented.
10 authoritative;



7 subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
6   range 192.168.0.2 192.168.0.20;
5   option routers 192.168.0.1;
4   option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
3 }
```



Remember to put 2 spaces for tabs.


### Testing proper dhcp configuration file

```bash
/sbin/dhcpd -t
```

You shouldn't see any mistakes

## Configuring the DHCP server

### Testing for errors

```bash
systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
```

Note the Main PID number and the error

if you don't see the error do the following command

```bash
journalctl _PID = <PID>
```
### Running the DHCP server 

sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
    
if you see the error: Not configured to listen on any interfaces!

simply configure the interface with an ip address
    
find out the list of interfaces you have with the command ip a
    
do ifconfig <interface name> up
    
    
if ever no ip address on the interface 

    ifconfig <interface name> 192.168.0.20
    
    

    
do 
```bash
systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
```  
you shoud see it active
    
## Testing if your dhcp server is working or not
    
    journalctl | grep DHCP
    
you should see the following messages:

## Problems happening
    
My laptop has no internet connection now
    
    route -n 
    
I see 2 default gateways
    
    sudo route del default gw 192.168.0.1

    
delete the one that is not useful
    
    
## Test the ping 
    
    ping 192.168.0.3
